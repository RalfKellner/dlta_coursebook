    "# Case study form 8K filings\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the impressions from the last chapter, we want to examine the relation between textual information and stock market reactions a little further. Entities which issue securities must file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A full list of all forms can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/forms), however, for stock market companies, common filings are of form 4, 8K, 10Q and 10K. Form 4 filings need to be filed by directors, officers and owners holding more than 10\\% of a company's shares. Form 4 filings include statements of ownerships and inform the public about ownership changes which could rely upon insider information. These filings usually do not include a large amount of textual information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, 10Q and 10K form filings are quarterly and annual reports which are filed on a regular basis and include a large amount of textual information. If events occur which should be announced to the shareholders of the company between quarterly and annual reports, 8K forms must be filed. These filings usually are shorter than 10Q and 10K filings, however, due to their ad-hoc nature, they may cause the largest stock market reactions. This is why we are going to focus on form 8K filings and corresponding stock market reactions in this case study.\n",

    "The historgrams above exhibit aggregated financial sentiment which is derived as described before. We observe that 8-K filings themselves seem to be written in a very neutral tone. However, exhibhts are characterized by very positive tone. It can not be stated with certainty if this observation is impacted by a potential positive bias the FinBert model may have or it is simply based on the fact that Apple is a successful company which is more likely to share positive statements about their development. To examine this in a little more detail, we contrast these measures by the dictionary based polarity approach as described in Chapter 2, hereby, using the Loughrain and McDonald (2011) dictionary. The cellse below show that we can not find a similar positive bias. At the same time, the correlation between FinBert and Loughrain/McDonald sentiment is relatively high for exhibits. "

    "As describe in the previous chapter, we want to examine the relationship between polarity in each report and exhibit and the cumulative abnormal return. This time, we use the Fama/French three factor model to determine Apple's abnormal returns. The cells below show positive correlation between FinBert polarity scores and cumulative abnormal returns. At the same time Loughrain/McDonald polarity and cumulative abnormal returns is close to zero and slightly negative. The latter does not seem to be in line with economic intuition. We would expect that postive statements by the company should trigger positive stock market reactions. "
