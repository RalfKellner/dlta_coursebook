    "Just as numerical representations of words can be learned, it is also possible to learn numerical representations of documents. The term document is used here as a general interpretation of various related texts such as sentences, sections, pages or documents. Modern language models aim to learn numerical representations of documents which capture semantic meaning as well as inherent relationships of tokens within the document. While we approach more sophisticated language models at a later stage of this course, we start with two variants which are natural additions to the Word2Vec variants of the last section.\n",

    "In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4053), the authors demonstrate how Word2Vec approaches can be adjusted to learn numerical representations of documents. The picture below repeats the CBOW and SG variants of Word2Vec. While CBOW uses surrounding words in the context of a center word to predict the center word, SG aims to predict the surrounding words by the center word. Independent of the variant, words are represented by vectors which can be used to determine word occurrence probabilities. "

The PV-DM approach is build in analogy to the CBOW model. It works in the same way, however, a document specific vector is added to the vectors of the surrounding words to predict the center word in a part of the document text. The PV-DBOW is created in analogy to the SG model. Given a document, we use its vector to predict the occurence of a word in the document. "

    "However, it is also possible to train an update word vectors during training the document vectors. If we set the *dbow_words* argument to $1$, the documentation states that word vectors are trained by SG, while document vectors are trained by PV-DBOW. The positive side effect of this training procedure is that we generate meaningful word embeddings which can also examined w.r.t. to document similarity. Consequently, we can, e.g., examine how similar the meaning of a document is to the meaning of a word. This characteristic can be employed for topic modeling approaches as demonstrated by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09470). We come back to this in the last subsection of this chapter.\n",

For instance, we can train a model which uses the numerical representation to predict the sentiment of the document. Another application is to group documents according to their numerical representation. The result are groups of document which are similar to each other and dissimilar to documents from other groups. If we interpret a group of documents as a topic, we get an idea about different topics in corpora such as financial news, annual company reports, etc. \n",

    "Given the data set with labels and document vectors, one can choose among a great variety of different machine learning models suited for multi-class prediction. The actual prediction model is not in the center of interest in this chapter. Below, we import a prediction model and evaluate the model by looking the the confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a tool used in classification tasks to visualize and summarize the performance of a classification model. It is a table that compares the predicted labels from the model with the actual labels of a dataset. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class (or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, all instances on the diagonal are correct predictions of the model, other instances are misclassifications. For instance for the hold out data on the right, 74 instances of positive sentiment predictions (2) are indeed the positive category. However, for 14 instances, a neutral sentence is predicted to be positive and even in 25 instances a negative sentence is predicted to be positive. The actual model performance is not that important for our example. The example is supposed to demonstrate a popular application of the Doc2Vec model "

    "The idea of finding similar documents and grouping them together can be done more systematically by clustering documents according to their vectors. In detail, this approach usually:\n",
    "\n",
    "* uses a dimensionality reduction to reduce the dimension of document vectors\n",
    "* uses a clustering algorithm to group documents in the reduced dimension\n",
    "* averages document vectors for each cluster in their original dimension to calculate topic vectors\n",
    "* given a Word2Vec model is trained together with the Doc2Vec model, one can further determine words with high cosine similarities to each topic vectors to generate a understanding which keywords describe the topics\n",
    "\n",
    "While the details of this approach are beyond the scope of this course, the intuition should be clear, once the concept of document and word vectors is understood. Clustering algorithms group observations which are defined by numbers (in our scenario the document vectors) in a way such that members of each cluster have high cosine similarities to each other, but, rather low cosine similarities to members of other clusters. As document vectors have high similarities if the documents content is similar, a group of similar documents is supposed to be related to a topic. For our example below we reduce the UMAP algorithm for reducing the document vector dimension to 10 and groupt these vectors by the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm. The latter assigns the cluster -1 for all members which can not be clearly assigned to a group of documents. For the 4,217 sentences, the algorithm finds 52 groups."

    "Alright, equipped with Word2Vec and Doc2Vec we are able to generate embeddings of words and documents which capture similarities in the meaning. However, these models are not able to understand context. For instance, given the two sentences \"Peter buys a lot of junk food and eats it all\", \"Peter buys salad to start a healthy life\", the word \"buy\" is going to be treated in the same way by a Doc2Vec model. However given the context of junk food or salad, the first sentence rather has a negative sentiment while the second sentence has positive sentiment. Modern language models use mechanism which capture contextual information. In the next chapter we take a look at the transformer model which includes an attention mechanism that allows the model to learn the meaning of context. "
