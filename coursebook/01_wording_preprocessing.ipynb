    "\n",
    "Let us refer to text analysis, text analytics or text mining as a process which extracts useful information from data using statistical algorithms techniques from natural language processing. Before we are able to start with text analysis, we need to gather text data and prepare it in certain ways to ease the use of text models. \n",

    "\n",
    "Usually texts such as financial reports, news or others are available in digital form. Either embedded as content on web pages using hypertext markup language (HTML) or by downloading common text files such as pdf-files. If we want collect text from these sources we either need to manually collect them or we make use of techniques like web scraping. For many different types of text, this already has been done by third-party providers and text is available upon request from these providers. However, we often receive texts in raw format with special characters and other peculiarities that make direct further processing difficult. For instance, take a look at the output below which shows you the beginning of the scraped raw text format of [this](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm) company filing. As you can see, for this example even some metadata is included before the actual content of the report begins."

This usually includes normalization steps such as removing unneeded white space, stripping accents, lower casing, etc. The Stanford Natural Language Processing group describes a token as *an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing*. Learning useful tokens is a task which is learned by algorithms such as Byte-Pair-Encoding or Wordpiece. Interested readers can get some first information about these algorithms at [huggingface's documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/components#pretokenizers). Below, we can take a look how the BERT model and its pretrained tokenizer would preprocess the example sentence from above."

    "### Earning call transcripts\n",
    "\n",
    "For a large number of companies, earning calls are held around quarterly reports. Earning calls are webcasts or phone calls with firm representatives, investors and analysts of a company. Usually, firm representative make the save harbour statement in the beginning of a call. After the initial statement, investors and analysts are allowed to ask questions which usually relate to the report and corresponding financial as well as operational results. See [this example](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/10/27/apple-aapl-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/) to get a first impression. \n",

    "### Voluntary reports\n",
    "\n",
    "While annual audited reports are usually mandatory, many firms tend to publish further information in voluntary reports. Popular voluntary reports are corporate social responsibilty (CSR) reports or environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) reports. These so called non-financial factors tend to become more important to investors and companies. A common point of view is that companies which are not able to manage environmental, social and governance issues properly exhibit higher risks for which investors want to be compensated. Until today, voluntary CSR or ESG reports are an important source of information for investors to understand corresponding risks with this respect. Note that the wording CSR and ESG is often mixed. See [this exapmle](https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/2022/08/2022_Apple_ESG_Report.pdf) to get a first impression. While ESG reports do not have to filed mandatory until today, certain information need to be provided mandatory in the near future in the EU and the US.\n",

    "\n",
    "Financial news are popular for text analysis. While it sound pretty straight forward in the beginning, extracting useful information from financial news can be challenging. As news tend to be backward looking and repetitive in many cases. Nevertheless, interesting applications of news analysis exist, e.g., to identify systematic market movements."
