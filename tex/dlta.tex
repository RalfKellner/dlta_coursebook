		\begin{itemize}
			\item The course consists of a lectures on Thursday 12-14, HK 28 (SR 010) and exercises on Wednesday (12-14), HK 14b (SR 315) or Wednesday (16-18), HK 14b (SR 016)
			\item If you are interested in python and how to could text analysis by yourself, a voluntary session is every Thursday 12-14, HK 28 (SR 010) starting on October 24
			\item Lectures discuss theoretical and empirical topics of the course
			\item Exercises repeat the content, however, with a perspective on applications and calculations
			\item You should participate in both, if you can't, team up with your fellow students
			\item The exam is paper based, it includes output from data analysis as well as questions which include calculations or open questions

	\begin{frame}{Welcome to the Course}
		Welcome to the course \textbf{Deep Learning and Text Analysis in Finance}.
		\vspace{0.3cm}
		
		Traditionally, companies were analyzed using financial data such as balance sheets and financial statements. However, today non-financial factors and textual information are increasingly important. Textual information spreads from different sources such as:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Financial reports
			\item News
			\item Transcripts of earnings calls
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{0.3cm}
		This course will focus on analyzing financial text using modern language models.
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Course Methodology}
		In this course, you will explore:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Frequency and dictionary-based text models
			\item Neural networks
			\item Distributional word and document embeddings
			\item Transformer-based text models
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{0.3cm}
		The course covers both text modeling methodologies and practical applications in finance, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and market value prediction.
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Text Types and Applications}
		The course will analyze various financial texts:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Corporate filings (10K) from US companies
			\item Earning call transcripts
			\item Financial news
			\item Voluntary ESG reports
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{0.3cm}
		Key tasks include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Text preprocessing
			\item Topic analysis using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec
			\item Sentiment prediction using transformer-based language models
		\end{itemize}
